= Create Releases

This repository contains GitHub releases as well as Helm chart releases.
They are using separate versioning scheme, each using SemVer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Any Pull Request _must_ clearly isolate code changes from Helm chart changes.
Otherwise, there could be issues with the release automation and the generated changelog.
====

[NOTE]
====
Changes to the repository boilerplate, CI/CD or similar shall be considered as normal code change.
====

[TIP]
====
The PR template reminds you how to separate and label PRs.
====

== Operator Release

Releasing a new version of the operator requires pushing a **new Git tag**, following the SemVer schema with a **`v` prefix**.
Optionally, for prereleases they may contain a ascending release candidate suffix with `-rc#`.

.Possible Operator Git tags
[example]
====
- `v0.1.2`
- `v1.4.0`
- `v2.0.0-rc1`
- `v2.0.0-rc2`
====

The changelog will be automatically created and is based on merged PRs.
PRs that affect Helm charts are excluded.
The following labels must exist on a PR to be included in the changelog:

- `area:operator`
- one of [`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `change`, `breaking`, `dependency`]

Once the operator is released, consider creating another PR that updates the Helm chart with the newly-created release tag.

== Helm Chart Release

Releasing a new version of a Helm chart requires pushing a **new Git tag**, following the SemVer schema with a **chart name prefix**, for example `provider-postgresql-1.2.3`.
It's recommended to create a PR for each Helm chart change separately.
After merging a PR for a Helm chart it's _not_ required to immediately release it.

The PR should only contain changes in the `charts/` directory.
Each affected chart _must_ set the version in `Chart.yaml` to the same as the Git tag, following SemVer.
The chart README _must_ be generated using `make chart-docs` to ensure that the README is generated using special comments in `values.yaml`.

.Possible Helm chart Git tags
[example]
====
- `provider-postgresql-1.2.3`
====

The changelog will be automatically created and is based on merged PRs.
PRs that affect code changes are excluded.
The following labels must exist on a PR to be included in the changelog:

- `area:chart`
- `chart:provider-postgresql`
- one of [`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `change`, `breaking`, `dependency`]

If the Helm chart updates the image tag for the operator, it's recommended to set a title like `Update image tag to vx.y.z` or similar and set the `dependency` label.

[NOTE]
====
Prereleases for Helm charts are currently not supported.
