== `forInstance`

=== `enableSuperUser`

Exposes the credentials for the `postgres` super user into the connection secret.
This allows complete control over the database server.

For example, users can create multiple databases and users on the same instance.

=== `majorVersion`

The major version for PostgreSQL to install.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once the instance resource is created using a specific major version, it cannot be changed afterwards.
====

=== `resources`

`memoryLimit`::
Maximum memory the instance can use (shared over all databases).
If the usage exceeds this limit, an OOM (Out-of-Memory) exception causes the instance to crash.
In such cases the instance automatically restarted by Kubernetes.

`storageCapacity`::
Maximum storage capacity allocated for the instance (shared over all databases).
If the disk usage exceeds this limit, PostgreSQL will encounter Out-of-Space errors and crash.
In such cases the user must manually increase the storage limit.
+
NOTE: Storage capacity can only be increased (grow).
